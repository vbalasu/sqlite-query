# sqlite-query

Query any SQLite Database from your browser!

Simply provide the URL of the remote SQLite database to get started. You can browse a list of tables and views, and execute arbitrary SQL queries.

If the database download is blocked due to CORS policy, it goes through a proxy running at https://sqlite-query.cloudmatica.com.
